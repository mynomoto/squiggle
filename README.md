# Squiggle

A Clojure library designed to transform maps in well crafted SQL code.
It has a still unfinished [spec](https://github.com/mynomoto/squiggle/blob/master/SPEC).

## Why???

I like to see what I'm doing. It's just a plain map so it's harder for
anything to hide from you.

Squiggle uses the new clojure.java.jdbc API.

So this is not Korma. It's more like honeysql but I only found that later
and Squiggle already works for create and drop tables, insert, update and
delete statements.

And finally, the idea is have something that can generate sql optimized
for each db. Now it only tested in H2 but should partially work with Derby,
HSQL, Mysql, Postgresql. I will need help from people that use other dbs to
add specific characteristics.

## Usage

Add to your dependencies `[squiggle "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]`.

Require the namespace `squiggle.core`.

There are only two public functions. `sql-gen` and `sql-exec!`.

The maps are better explained in the SPEC.md file.

```clojure
(ns your.namespace
  (:require [squiggle.core :as sq]))

; db is a jdbc connection map.
(def db {:classname   "org.h2.Driver"
         :subprotocol "h2"
         :subname     "resources/db/squiggle.db"})

; the most simple command map for select
(def select-users
  {:command :select
   :table :user})

; this gives you the query vector. The first argument is
; the db and the second is the command map.
(sq/sql-gen :h2 select-users)
; ["SELECT * FROM \"user\""]

; and this executes the query vector. First arg is the db,
; second is the connection map and the third is the command
; map
(sq/sql-exec! :h2 db select-users)

; you can create a table with this command map
(def create-user-table
  {:command :create
   :table :user
   :column-schema [[:id :identity :primary-key]
                   [:username :varchar :not-null]
                   [:password :varchar :not-null]]})

; you can drop a table
(def drop-user-table
  {:command :drop
   :table :user})

; you can create an index
(def create-index
  {:command :create-index
   :table :user
   :column :username})

; insert
(def insert-user
  {:command :insert
   :table :user
   :column [:username :password]
   :value [["admin" "secret"]]})

; delete
(def delete-user
  {:command :delete
   :table :user
   :where [:= :username "admin"]})

; update
(def update-user
  {:command :update
   :table :user
   :set [[:= :username "user1000"]]
   :where [:= :id 1]})
```

## TODO

* Add limit to update
* Add limit and top to delete
* Add union, intersection, except queries
* Add alter table and other alter and create commands
